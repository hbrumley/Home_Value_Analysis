## Capstone Project Proposal 1

For my capstone project I am looking at PUMS housing data. I will be creating a regression to predict home prices. I am also interested in which of the input variables are the strongest predictors.

My client will be professionals in the real estate industry. I would like to show how strongly the housing price can be predicted from the data and to be able to demonstrate a few variables that are most strongly correlated with home values. I think this would be very useful to real estate professionals.

I have the data from the PUMS website, as well as the corresponding data dictionary. The data is somewhat encoded so I will need to clean it into easily readable data.

I first want to see how well a linear regression model will predict the data. Once I have the results of the linear model I will look into more advanced models as needed.

The finished product will be a Jupyter notebook with code, English writing, and charts incorporated to clearly explain the process.

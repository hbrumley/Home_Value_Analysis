The dataset for this project was easily available online. The largest issue of data wrangling was manually reading the data, as the column headers were represented by 2-4 letter codes and the data was encoded by integers. Thankfully PUMS provided a document explaining each column’s name and the meaning of the numerical representation in each column. Then it came down to feature selection. Roughly half of the file was simply allocation flags to mark when a question was answered, so that left 44 columns, including the target column. Many of the features were mutually exclusive, so I took out the columns with the most missing data. I was left with 15 feature columns and one target column with 533,806 observations.


Next I just had to adjust some of the monetary columns for inflation. This was fairly straightforward as the dataset gave an adjustment factor. The state column needed to be separated using one hot encoding, as it had four categorical values. All the other categorical values were simple Yes/No options and as such did not require one hot encoding. I converted the “Year Built” column into an age column so that there was a ‘nicer’ range of values to work with.

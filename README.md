# Abstract: PUMS Home Value Classification

We are analyzing the 2011-2015 PUMS housing data, found [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums.html). The data dictionary which explains the meaning of each column and the values contained within is available [here.](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/pums/documentation.2015.html) PUMS is an annual national survey of personal and household data. I chose this dataset primarily because I believe the large sample provides enough data to create an interesting story. The largest issue of data wrangling was manually reading the data, as the column headers were represented by 2-4 letter codes and the data was encoded by integers. Thankfully PUMS provides a document explaining each columnâ€™s name and the meaning of the numerical representation in each column. Then it came down to feature selection. Roughly half of the file was simply allocation flags to mark when a question was answered, so that left 44 columns, including the target column. Many of the features were mutually exclusive, i.e. all the columns about rental would have lots of blanks if we look at mortgage and homeowner's insurance, so I took out the columns with the most missing data. We are left with 16 features and one target column with 533,806 observations.

**Goal:** Our goal is to find an algorithm that can predict the value of the home. We initially attempt to solve the problem using regression. Then we will alter the problem to a classification problem, with a more satisfactory accuracy of 74.7 percent.
